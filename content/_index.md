# Hi! I'm Alex!

I'm a software engineer and all-around millennial from the Mitten, currently in Seattle.

Right now, I work building declarative tools and code generators over at
[Google](https://www.google.com). I'm currently working on the [Declarative
Resource Client
Library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/declarative-resource-client-library).
My work is helping to build declarative client tools like [Kubernetes Config
Connector](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview). or
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible-collections/google.cloud). I was working
on [Magic Modules](https://www.github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform) code generator
before that.

Before that, I was at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com) building data pipelines. Before that, I was at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) (Go Blue!).

You can find me spewing nonsense over on the bird app [@rambleraptor](https://www.twitter.com/rambleraptor) and over on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rambleraptor). Or you can always [email me](mailto:astephen2@gmail.com).
